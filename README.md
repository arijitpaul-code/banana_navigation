# banana_navigation
Udacity Deep RL Banana navigation project

Project Details

The project is to train an agent to collect yellow bananas for reeward of +1 (and avoid blue bananas for reward of -1) in the Banana Unity Environment, by using Deep Reinforcement Learning through DQN and it's variants. The environment has 37 state dimensions with 4 possible actions (front, back, left, right). The environment is considered solved when the model achieves a score of 13 or more.


Getting Started

The dependencies for the progream are in requirements.txt file, following the instrcutions in https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods#dependencies, with the banana unity environment sourced directly from (for Linux) https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip and extracted and placed in the p1_navigation/ folder. After that cuda support was installed using conda install cudatoolkit

Instructions

The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent.
